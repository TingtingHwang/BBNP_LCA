# Data source and description
All data were projected into the same coordinate system (British_National_Grid), with uniform boundaries and then resampled using the nearest-neighbour method to obtain a uniform 30m resolution. The data processing was carried out in ArcGIS Desktop 10.8.2 and finally saved in GeoTIFF format.

LCA relies on understanding and mapping the heterogeneity of landscape characters, both in terms of natural and human-made elements \citep{turner2015}. Seven Landscape Character Elements (LCEs) are used in this search, they are altitude, geology, soil, landform, vegetation, landcover, and historic landscape (Table \ref{tab:LVMA}). These datasets include 60 variables, as listed in \ref{appendixA}. Altitude is obtained from NASA EARTHDATA, with 12.5 m resolution \citep{ALOS2006}. The geology is Derived from 1:50,000 scale BGS Digital Data under Licence No. 2023/098 British Geological Survey Â© and Database Right UKRI \citep{BGS2023} . The soil is a 1:250,000 scale, obtained from National Soil Map of England and Wales - NATMAP (UK Soil Observatory, Cranfield). The landform and the historic landscape are obtained from the Natural Resources Wales. The vegetation and landcover \citep{Owers2021} are derived from the Living Wales, with 10 m resolution. All the data are projected into the same coordinate system, and then resampled using the Nearest Neighbour method to achieve a uniform 30 m pixel resolution.
